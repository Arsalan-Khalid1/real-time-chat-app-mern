This is the test project for real time chat application, so I have tried to keep it as simple as possible.

It sums up the concept of web sockets, which opens up the UDP protocol for real time packets transfer.

In order to run this project follow these steps

1) cd test-chat-app-frontend
2) npm install
3) npm start
4) cd ..
5) cd test-chat-app-backend
6) npm install
7) create .env file at root and add your connection url for mongodb and set the key as "DB"
8) npm start

Thanks
